4.8

  [Bryan Christ] Add APIs to externalize color mapping
  interfaces so that external programs can access them.

4.7

  [Bryan Christ] Make color pair extraction more
  opaque and give more control to caller.  This also
  fixes a performance problem seen on Fedora 29 where ncursesw
  pair_content() is about 7x slower.

4.6

  [Bryan Christ] Make color indexing more opaque and
  give more control to caller.  Results in about a 
  10 percent performance gain over the default functions
  when used correctly.

4.5

  [Bryan Christ} Make writes to wnd from matrix faster.

4.4

  [Bryan Christ] Handle control character for tab stops
  correctly.

4.3

  [Bryan Christ] Add TERM PRESIZE event hook to signal
  when the terminal is about to be resized.

4.2

  [Bryan Christ] Handle csi for absolute cursor address
  movement.

4.1

  [Bryan Christ] Properly handle crazy RS1 reset sequence
  emitted by rxvt.

4.0

  [Bryan Christ] Full support for UTF-8 encoded Unicode.

3.12

  [Bryan Christ] make libvterm build and link against
  the wide version of ncurses (ncursesw.h) as a step
  toward full utf8 support.

3.11

  [Bryan Christ] make read size a multiple of PIPE_BUF
  to minimize child process blocking.

3.10

  [Bryan Christ] make the utf8 decoder more robust,
  easier to read, an possibly a little bit faster.

3.9

  [Bryan Christ] map utf8 double line drawing codes to
  ACS similars.

3.8

  [Bryan Christ] use clues from Bash to detect and handle if
  a program crashes while in alternate buffer mode.

3.7

  [Bryan Christ] added a hook system for programs that need to
  know when certain events have transpired and need to take
  action.
  [Bryan Christ] copied in some color routines into demo
  program to make it easier to use and more educational for
  the reader.
  [Bryan Christ] some code to use new hook system in
  demo program.

3.6

  [Bryan Christ] mimic unicode "middle-tee" with ACS_PLUS.

3.5

* [Bryan Christ] Make ICH CSI behave correctly.

3.4

* [Bryan Christ] If the terminal was resized while in alternate
  buffer mode, the standard buffer needs to be resized
  accordingly when alternate mode terminates.

3.3

* [Bryan Christ] Fixed a SEGV caused by massive ICH moves.
  Implemented as a workaround.  Full fix later.

3.2

* [Bryan Christ] Fixed a SEGV caused by high-velocity applications
  we made malloc blow up.

3.1

* [Bryan Christ] Fix a double-free situation.

3.0

* [Bryan Christ] Added support for multiple buffers.
* [Bryan Christ] Improved handling of OSC codes including a new
  API for fetching window title.
* [Bryan Christ] Performance improvements in parsing systems.
* [Bryan Christ] Bugfixes.
* [Bryan Christ] Update demo program for showcase and testing.

2.5

* [Bryan Christ] Fixed some compiler warnings and improperly
  typed functions in demo program.

2.4

* [Bryan Christ] Implement trapping of cursor save and cursor restore
  CSI codes which makes the 'apt' package manager output more pleasant.
* [Bryan Christ] Added reference documentation folder so others can
  follow along.

2.3

* [Bryan Christ] Added more API documentation.
* [Bryan Christ] Update demo program to handle resizing.
* [Bryan Christ] Added new interface for granular resizing and a macro
  to preserve the simpler interface.

2.2

* [Bryan Christ] Make vshell window size vary according to the
  size of the terminal it's running in.
* [Bryan Christ] Fix a long-standing bug with the bold
  attribute.

2.1

* [Bryan Christ] set (or clear) COLORTERM environment variable
  depending on init flags.

2.0

* [Bryan Christ] API change that enables caller to pass in an
  alternate binary path which uses execv() to launch.  In
  compliment to this change the vshell demo program was updated
  with a --exec paramenter to support passing in programs from
  the command line.

1.13

* [Bryan Christ] added --vt100 command line parameter for
  vshell demo program.

1.12

* [Bryan Christ] modified build so that curses can be intentionally
  ignored by specifiying 'cmake -DDEFINE_CURSES=OFF'

1.11

* [Bryan Christ] improved SGR handling of colors and attributes
  which improves cdw and myman compatibility.

1.10

* [Bryan Christ] convert to CMake build system

1.00

* [Bryan Christ] fixed a long standing bug in the newline code.
  it was an easy fix but it took me clearing the forest to see
  the tree.  libterm now works great with every piece of test
  software except some utf-8 glyphs don't show.

0.99.16

* [Bryan Christ] security fix to prevent recursion bomb that was
  introduced in 0.99.15

*  [Bryan Christ] fixed the backspace key for getline() and other tools
   that modify terminal attributes.
